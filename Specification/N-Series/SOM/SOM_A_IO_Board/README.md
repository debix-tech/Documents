## Overview
DEBIX SOM A I/O Board is a carrier board designed for DEBIX SOM A, which connects to 
DEBIX SOM A through 4 double-sided board-to-board socket connectors on its front side. 
It's all about full-featured interfaces supported by the core board based on i.MX 8M Plus, 
and provides a perfect solution combining the functions required for industrial control, 
IoT connection and multimedia.

## Main Features
- **Feature-rich interfaces** to take advantage of the i.MX 8M Plus processor to the
fullest extent
- **Flexible boot options:** Besides boot from eMMC on DEBIX SOM A, the I/O Board
supports boot from Micro SD and SPI Nor Flash
- **Industrial-grade isolation:** The serial ports, CAN and GPIO of the I/O Board are
designed with isolation, dedicated to industrial and IoT applications
- **Powerful Connectivity:** Support dual Gigabit Ethernet with POE function, 2.4GHz &
5GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0
