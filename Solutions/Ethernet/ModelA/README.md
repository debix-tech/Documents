# üì° Ethernet (EQoS & FEC) - i.MX8MP

## üìò Overview

This platform is equipped with two Gigabit Ethernet controllers:

* **EQoS (Enhanced QoS Ethernet MAC):** Supports features such as multi-queue scheduling and DMA queue mapping.
* **FEC (Fast Ethernet Controller):** Standard RGMII interface, supports Magic Packet wake-up functionality.


## üìÇ Driver Source Code Locations

‚úÖ 1. EQoS Driver (DesignWare EQOS):  
`drivers\net\ethernet\stmicro\stmmac\stmmac_main.c`

‚úÖ 2. FEC Driver (NXP i.MX FEC):  
`drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/fec_main.c`

### **Usage Test 1:**

1. Bring up the Ethernet interfaces:

```shell
ifconfig ens33 up 
ifconfig ens34 up 
```

2. Test network connectivity:

```shell
ping 8.8.8.8
```

üß™ *Optional:* Use `iperf3` for bandwidth stress testing.

---

### **Usage Test 2: Wake CPU via Ethernet**

#### 1. Enable Wake-on-LAN feature:

> Supports Wake-on: g
> Wake-on: g

```shell
root@imx8mp-debix:~# ethtool -s ens34 wol g
root@imx8mp-debix:~# ethtool ens34
Settings for ens34:

```

#### 2. Check IP and MAC address:

```shell
root@imx8mp-debix:~# ifconfig
ens34: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.2.56  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.2.255
        inet6 fe80::1207:23ff:fe6e:be6  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether 10:07:23:6e:0b:e6  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 1126  bytes 132697 (129.5 KiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 192  bytes 18823 (18.3 KiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

#### 3. Enter suspend mode:

```shell
root@imx8mp-debix:~# echo mem > /sys/power/state
[  934.957246] PM: suspend entry (deep)
[  934.961277] Filesystems sync: 0.000 seconds
[  934.966689] Freezing user space processes
[  934.972279] Freezing user space processes completed (elapsed 0.001 seconds)
[  934.979283] OOM killer disabled.
[  934.982518] Freezing remaining freezable tasks
[  934.988208] Freezing remaining freezable tasks completed (elapsed 0.001 seconds)
[  934.995631] printk: Suspending console(s) (use no_console_suspend to debug)
```

#### 4. Send a network packet from a PC to wake up the board:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure the PC and the DEBIX board are on the same local network (LAN).

On the PC, run:

```shell
wakeonlan -i 192.168.2.56 10:07:23:6e:0b:e6
```

After sending, the DEBIX board will wake up, and you should see output like:

```shell
[  935.382694] Enabling non-boot CPUs ...
