## DEBIX FAQ - Software Questions

**1. What should I do if the flashing fails?**  
You can restore it through re-programming the SD card.

**2. What operating system does it support?**  
Our products support various operating systems, including Ubuntu,Android, Yocto, Debian and Windows

**3. Can PC or Mac software be run on DEBIX?**  
No, DEBIX only supports ARM64 linux software.

**4. Will it run old software?**  
In general, you need to see if it supports programming for Armv6, Armv7, or Armv8 architectures on Linux. In most cases, the answer is yes. There is nothing more direct than using DEBIX and testing it to find out the answer!

**5. How to share documents from DEBIX with windows computers?**  
You can share files with windows computers via samba or ftp.

**6. How to run the program at startup?**  
After Linux is loaded, it will initialize the hardware and device drivers, and then run the first process `init`. `Init` continues the boot process according to the configuration file and starts other processes. Usually, the modification is placed in script files in the following directory:   
     `/etc/rc` or   
     `/etc/rc.d` or   
     `/etc/rc?.d`  
You can make `init` start other programs automatically, such as editing `/etc/rc.d/rc.local` file (this file is usually the last script started by the system), adding a line "xinit" or "startx" at the end of the file and entering X-Window directly after booting up.


**7. How to run the program at a specific time?**  
Linux has a daemon called crond, whose main function is to periodically check the contents of a set of command files in the /var/spool/cron directory and execute the commands in these files at a set time. Users can create, modify, and delete these command files through the crontab command.  
For example, create a file crondFile with the content "00 9 23 Jan * HappyBirthday". After running the "crontab cronFile" command, the system will automatically execute the "Happy Birthday" program at 9:00 am on January 23 ("*" means no matter what day is the day of the week).

**8. Why there’s no response when I am entering the password?**  
- If it is a graphical interface, you can check the status of your input method;
- If it is a text interface, the password is not displayed when entering the password. After you enter the correct password, just press the enter key.

**9. Why is there no real-time clock?**  
Due to insufficient space there's no real-time clock. There are two sets of I2C pin headers reserved, and an RTC clock module can be connected by yourself.

**10. How to modify the software source of the Ubuntu system?**  
(1) Back up the original file (optional step);  
    `sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.bak`

(3) Update: `sudo apt-get update`.

**11. After inserting the USB device, I enter lsusb in the terminal and couldn't find any information about this device.**  
(1) Test the USB interface. For example, after you connect a USB mouse, execute lsusb to check if there is a mouse connected.  
(2) The peripherals cannot be identified. It is recommended to check whether other devices can be identified normally.

**12. How to modify the sleep mode?**  
In `Settings`-`Power`, there are "`press the key to sleep`" and "`scheduled sleep`" for options.

**13. How to configure the wireless network card when using a system without a desktop?**

`iwconfig wlan0 txpower on`  
The signal light of the wireless network should be on.  
(2) List wireless networks in the area:  
`iwlist wlan0 scan`  
(3) Assuming you want to connect to the network MyHome MyHome (essid is MyHom), then enter the command:  
`iwconfig wlan0 essid "MyHome"`  
If the network is encrypted and the password is 0123456789, then enter the command:  
`iwconfig wlan0 essid "MyHome" key 0123-4567-89`  
 
**14. Use FileZilla in Windows 10 but fail to connect DEBIX.**  
- Please check whether the IP address is the same with the IP address on the board.  
- Please check whether the IP address on window 10 has the same network segment with the IP address on DEBIX.


**15. How to configure the sound card?**  
Use `root` to log in and then run `/usr/sbin/sndconfig`, and you will see the interface for selecting sound card types. Generally you can select Sound Blaster. After selection you need to set relevant resources, in this process you can use `TAB key` and `direction keys` to make selections and then press `OK`. If you hear the voice of Linus (the founder of Linux), it means that the sound card is set up successfully.

*(Note: the default DEBIX user name/password is `debix`/`debix`)*

**20. How to enable SSH service?**  
(1) Find the sshd service configuration file `sshd_config` in the `/etc/ssh/` directory and open it with the Vim editor; Remove the "`#`" before the monitor port and monitor address in the file; then enable the remote login; Finally, enable the use of user name and password as connection verification; Save the file and exit;  
(2) If the connection fails, please enter `ps -e | grep sshd` to check whether the sshd service is enabled;  
(3) In order to avoid manual start of sshd service every time at startup, you can add the sshd service to the self-starting list and enter `systemctl enable sshd.service`;

/|/
---|---
1|country=CN
2|ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
3|update_config=1
4|
5|network={
6|ssid="WiFi-A"
7|psk="12345678"
8|key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
9|priority=1
10|}
11|
12|network={
13|ssid="WiFi-B"
14|psk="12345678"
15|key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
16|priority=2
17|scan_ssid=1
18|}

Instructions and configuration examples of WiFi with different security:  
```
#ssid: ssid of the network  
#psk: password  
#priority: Connection priority, a larger number means higher priority (a negative number is unacceptable)  
#scan_ssid: You need to specify the value to 1 when connecting to hidden WiFi  
```
<br>

If your WiFi has no password:  
/|/
---|---
1|network={
2|ssid="name of your wireless network（ssid）"
3|key_mgmt=NONE
4|}

<br>

If your WiFi uses WEP encryption:
/|/
---|---
1|network={
2|ssid="name of your wireless network（ssid）"
3|key_mgmt=NONE
4|wep_key0="your wifi password"
5|}

<br>
 
If your WiFi uses WPA/WPA2 encryption:
/|/
---|---
1|network={
2|ssid="name of your wireless network（ssid）"
3|key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
4|psk="your wifi password"
5|}
 
If you are not sure about the WiFi encryption mode, you can open `/data/misc/wifi/wpa/wpa_supplicant.conf` through root explorer on your Android phone to view the WiFi information.

If the Access denied prompt appears when connecting to DEBIX via ssh, it means that the ssh service is not enabled. If you want to enable it manually, you can create a new file (a blank file is acceptable) in the boot partition like WiFi configuration and name it ssh (use lowercase and do not have any extensions).

**24. Log in to DEBIX without a display device and unknown IP?**  
Use the network segment scanning tool, the software will automatically detect the network segment where the computer is located, and automatically determine the scanning range. (For example, the computer IP is 192.168.1.101, and the scanning range is 192.168.1.*), find the device whose manufacturer is "DEBIX".  
If you have the login authority of the router (such as home network), you can also directly query the IP address assigned to DEBIX by the router on the management interface of the router.
